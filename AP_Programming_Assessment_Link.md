## AP Programming Assessment

This AP programming practice assessment is designed to measure your ability to read and interpret pseudocode in order to solve problems accurately and efficiently.
You may use GitHub Codespaces to rewrite the pseudocode in Python to help test your logic, and you may also use pen and paper to trace, organize, or plan your solution.
