MOVE_FORWARD() — moves the robot forward one space
TURN_LEFT() — turns the robot 90° left
TURN_RIGHT() — turns the robot 90° right

1. The robot starts at position (0,0) facing EAST.
What is the robot’s final position and direction?

MOVE_FORWARD()
MOVE_FORWARD() 
TURN_LEFT() 
MOVE_FORWARD()

2. The robot starts at (0,0) facing NORTH.
Which best describes the robot’s final direction?

REPEAT 3 TIMES {
  MOVE_FORWARD()
  TURN_RIGHT()
}

3. The robot starts at (2,2) facing EAST.
What is the robot’s final position?

TURN_RIGHT()
MOVE_FORWARD()
TURN_LEFT()
MOVE_FORWARD()

4. The goal is for the robot to move forward 3 spaces.
How would you edit this code to accomplish this?

REPEAT 3 TIMES {
  TURN_LEFT()
  MOVE_FORWARD()
}

5. A robot is placed on a grid at position (0, 0) facing EAST.
The robot can use the following commands:

MOVE_FORWARD() — moves the robot forward one space
TURN_LEFT() — turns the robot 90° left
TURN_RIGHT() — turns the robot 90° right

Task:
Write an algorithm that moves the robot from its starting position (0, 0) to the target position (5, 9).

Your solution should:
Use only the commands listed above
Use loops where appropriate
Clearly show the sequence of steps the robot follows
