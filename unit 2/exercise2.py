# In your exercise2.py document, create a function that will 
# allow you to enter different numbers individually and 
# calculate the sum of those numbers. Your function should operate 
# on a while loop and allow the user to enter each number 
# 1 at a time, as many times as they want. Your function 
# should ask the user if they are done entering numbers,  
# When the user is done entering numbers your function 
# should add up and return the sum of those numbers. 
# If they are not done entering in numbers it should allow 
# them to enter another one.
